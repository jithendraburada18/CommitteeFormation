# Committee Formation

## Project Description
A decentralized committee selection system built on the Aptos blockchain that implements random committee formation for proposal evaluation. The smart contract allows organizations and DAOs to create committee pools, register candidates, and automatically select committee members using a pseudo-random selection mechanism based on blockchain timestamps. This ensures fair and transparent committee formation for governance proposals.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to democratize governance processes by providing a transparent, tamper-proof committee selection mechanism that eliminates bias and favoritism in decision-making bodies. We aim to create a foundational governance tool that can be used by DAOs, organizations, and communities to ensure fair representation and diverse perspectives in proposal evaluation and decision-making processes.

## Key Features
- **Transparent Committee Pool Creation**: Easy setup of committee pools with customizable committee size for specific proposals
- **Random Selection Algorithm**: Pseudo-random committee member selection using blockchain timestamps to ensure fairness
- **Candidate Registration System**: Open registration process allowing eligible participants to join candidate pools
- **Secure & Immutable**: Built on Aptos blockchain ensuring transparency and preventing manipulation of selection process
- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized Move code with minimal transaction costs for committee operations

## Future Scope
- **Weighted Random Selection**: Implement stake-based or reputation-based weighted random selection for committee members
- **Multi-Proposal Support**: Support multiple concurrent proposals with separate committee pools per proposal
- **Term Management**: Add committee term limits and rotation mechanisms for long-term governance structures
- **Qualification Criteria**: Implement candidate qualification checks and eligibility requirements before registration
- **Voting Integration**: Direct integration with voting mechanisms for seamless proposal evaluation workflow
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Dashboard for committee performance tracking and selection history analysis
- **Cross-DAO Compatibility**: Standardized committee formation protocol for interoperability across different DAOs
- **Appeal Mechanisms**: Implementation of selection challenge and appeal processes for disputed selections
